### Simple tool for scraping real-life tweets
If you want to run it yourself, you should add a `.env` file with your twitter credentials (`USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`) - only logged in users can browse twitter freely. The dependencies are listed inside `requirements.txt`, you can run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them (`.venv` recommended). Everything is ran using Selenium and I don't promise that it works 100% of the time. You should also keep in mind that it could **flag your account** (even though I made the script in a way so it isn't too suspicious...)
